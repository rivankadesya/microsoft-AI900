{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Object Detection\n","\n","*Object detection* is a form of computer vision in which a machine learning model is trained to classify individual instances of objects in an image, and indicate a *bounding box* that marks its location. You can think of this as a progression from *image classification* (in which the model answers the question \"what is this an image of?\") to building solutions where we can ask the model \"what objects are in this image, and where are they?\".\n","\n","![A robot identifying fruit](./images/object-detection.jpg)\n","\n","For example, a grocery store might use an object detection model to implement an automated checkout system that scans a conveyor belt using a camera, and can identify specific items without the need to place each item on the belt and scan them individually.\n","\n","The **Custom Vision** cognitive service in Microsoft Azure provides a cloud-based solution for creating and publishing custom object detection models.\n","\n","## Create a Custom Vision resource\n","\n","To use the Custom Vision service, you need an Azure resource that you can use to train a model, and a resource with which you can publish it for applications to use. You can use the same resource for each of these tasks, or you can use different resources for each to allocate costs separately provided both resources are created in the same region. The resource for either (or both) tasks can be a general **Cognitive Services** resource, or a specific **Custom Vision** resource. Use the following instructions to create a new **Custom Vision** resource (or you can use an existing resource if you have one).\n","\n","1. In a new browser tab, open the Azure portal at [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com), and sign in using the Microsoft account associated with your Azure subscription.\n","2. Select the **&#65291;Create a resource** button, search for *custom vision*, and create a **Custom Vision** resource with the following settings:\n","    - **Create options**: Both\n","    - **Subscription**: *Your Azure subscription*\n","    - **Resource group**: *Select or create a resource group with a unique name*\n","    - **Name**: *Enter a unique name*\n","    - **Training location**: *Choose any available region*\n","    - **Training pricing tier**: F0\n","    - **Prediction location**: *The same as the training location*\n","    - **Prediction pricing tier**: F0\n","\n","    > **Note**: If you already have an F0 custom vision service in your subscription, select **S0** for this one.\n","\n","3. Wait for the resource to be created.\n","\n","## Create a Custom Vision project\n","\n","To train an object detection model, you need to create a Custom Vision project based on your training resource. To do this, you'll use the Custom Vision portal.\n","\n","1.

Wait for the project to be created and opened in the browser.\n","\n","## Add and tag images\n","\n","To train an object detection model, you need to upload images that contain the classes you want the model to identify, and tag them to indicate bounding boxes for each object instance.\n","\n","1. Download and extract the training images from https://aka.ms/fruit-objects. The extracted folder contains a collection of images of fruit. **Note:** as a temporary workaround, if you are not able to access the training images, please go to https://www.github.com, then go to https://aka.ms/fruit-objects. \n","2. In the Custom Vision portal [https://customvision.ai](https://customvision.ai), make sure you are working in your object detection project _Grocery Detection_.
